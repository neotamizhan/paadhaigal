## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't rewrite everything at once** - Gradual migration is safer
2. **Don't skip security** - Implement auth/authz early
3. **Don't over-engineer** - Start simple, add complexity when needed
4. **Don't ignore costs** - Monitor AI API costs closely
5. **Don't forget testing** - Write tests as you go
6. **Don't neglect documentation** - Document as you build
7. **Don't skip user feedback** - Release early, iterate based on feedback
8. **Don't forget Tamil experts** - Always involve language experts for AI features

---

## 📝 Notes

- This checklist should be adapted based on team size and resources
- Prioritize based on user needs and business goals
- Some phases can be parallelized if you have multiple developers
- Always test in staging before production
- Keep users informed of changes and new features
