## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why modernize now?**  
A: Current stack is deprecated (AngularJS 1.x EOL 2022), has security issues, and lacks features users expect. Modernizing now positions for 10x growth.

**Q: Can we do this incrementally?**  
A: Yes! The roadmap is designed for phased implementation. Start with Quick Wins (30 days), then decide on next phases.

**Q: What if we have limited budget?**  
A: Start with MVP (6 months, $120K-200K) or just Foundation (4 months, $80K-150K). Even Quick Wins alone (<$10K) provide significant value.

**Q: Do we need all 33 AI features?**  
A: No. Start with top 5 (semantic search, auto-tagging, TTS, recommendations, AI explanations). Add more based on user feedback.

**Q: Can we use open-source instead of paid AI APIs?**  
A: Yes, partially. Use Tamil-BERT (free) for embeddings, but commercial LLMs provide better quality. Budget ~$500-2000/month for AI APIs.

**Q: What about data privacy?**  
A: The roadmap includes GDPR compliance, user consent for tracking, and privacy-first design. See Security sections in each phase.

**Q: How do we ensure cultural sensitivity?**  
A: Always involve Tamil language experts in AI training and content review. See "Ethical Considerations" in AI_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md.
